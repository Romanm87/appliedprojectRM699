## Abstract

In recent years, Twitter has become a popular microblogging tool for millions of users
worldwide. The sum of posted tweets represents a large data source for shared information and
opinions regarding a wide range of topics. Academic publications have shown that retrieval of
sentiment from tweets related to such topics offers valuable insight in popular opinions that can
be used to make predictions. I retrieve tweets that discuss five different cryptocurrencies,
Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple, Neo and Stellar, to find a correlation between tweet volume and
sentiment and price fluctuations in these cryptocurrencies. With Granger causality, I show
evidence of the collected Twitter dataâ€™s predictive power and I build and test a model that
forecasts cryptocurrency prices. I then show how the predictive power of Twitter volume and
sentiment varies with the popularity of a cryptocurrency and I demonstrate how the predictions
can be improved when measuring cryptocurrency prices in Bitcoin rather than in US Dollar to
focus on cryptocurrency price fluctuations relative to each other.
