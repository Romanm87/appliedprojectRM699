## Abstract

In recent years, Twitter has become a popular microblogging tool for millions of users worldwide. The sum of posted tweets represents a large data source for shared information and opinions regarding a wide range of topics. Academic publications have shown that retrieval of sentiment from tweets related to such topics offers valuable insight in popular opinions that can be used to make predictions. I retrieved a total of 1,020,448 tweets related to six different cryptocurrencies, Cardano, EOS, Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple, and Stellar to use an artificial neural network to determine the sentiment of their content and to subsequently find correlations among tweet volume, sentiment, and price fluctuations in these cryptocurrencies. With this analysis I found evidence for a strong correlation of sentiment and price among the six cryptocurrencies. However, significant correlation and causative relationships between volume and price and between sentiment and price could only be found in some cases. While discussing the results and their relevance, I also provide ideas for future direction of this study that might strengthen the hypothesis of Twitter dataâ€™s predictive power for cryptocurrency price movements.
