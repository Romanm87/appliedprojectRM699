I'm so sick of <e>Obama</e> <a>saying</a> our 2nd amendment is because we are a country that hunts. Its to protect us from an Obama tyranny. #debates
To all the <e>Obama</e> voters, your Prez is acting like he has not been Prez for the last 4 yrs, <a>talking</a> abt what he plans to do with problems now
<e>Obama</e> said he agrees w/ @MittRomney on lowering the corporate <a>tax</a> rate...really? Why haven't you done that in the last 4 yrs? #HofstraDebate
most people don't like blacks ppl because we prove our ignorance. so they don't like <e>Obama</e> bc he <a>looks</a> like us.
There you <a>go..."Jobs</a> are not coming back" <e>-Obama</e>
<e>Obama</e> stop <a>interupting</a> you fucking pussy. Loose with some respect!
Romney makes good point in everything he's said <e>Obama</e> is coming up with every <a>excuse</a> to make himself look good
Hope I get to duck hunt this season before <e>Obama</e> takes my <a>guns</a> #trymebitch

Dear, <e>Obama</e> you're not a hard ass! Sit down! "Some <a>jobs</a> are not going to comeback" this is what you want America no jobs?! Goodluck...
Is it just me or is the debate <e>moderator</e> very <a>biased</a> for <e>Obama</e> #makeobamashutup
Hey, <e>Obama...corporations</e> STILL don't pay <a>taxes</a> this week, or the next week, either...no matter how many ... http://t.co/h47o7XL5
We need to bring <a>jobs</a> back <e>Obama?</e> You said you would do that 4 years ago...#debates
I'm not even saying <e>Obama</e> just cause he's <a>black</a> but my future is at risk also.
<e>Candy</e> <a>gotta</a> <a>thang</a> <a>for</a> Obama I promise. She be smiling when she ask Obama questions and she took up for him earlier
I wish <e>Obama</e> would stop <a>interrupting</a> and actually <a>answer</a> the question asked not go on about something else #shutup #sitdown
Something <a>wrong,</a> <e>Obama?</e> http://t.co/ER9ve4DQ
<a>Fuck</a> <e>Obama</e>
@seanhannity This is a great question for Romney to rebutt <e>Obama's</e> negative <a>ads...</a>
AK-47's used in <a>"gang</a> <a>banging",</a> as <e>Obama</e> put it, are not purchased legally in the US.  Assault Rifle ban does not solve that prob. #Admend2
This <e>moderator</e> needs <e>Obama</e> to <a>win</a> so the government forces her to lose weight
<e>Obama</e> looks <a>foolish</a> on the China issue!
We're all children of the same God say ROmeny.  Except <e>Obama.</e>  He's the <a>devil</a>  #debates
It seem like <e>Obama</e> never really have time to <a>make</a> his <a>point</a> but Romney do ??
#nbcPolitics I looove how <e>Romney</e> is <a>trashing</a> Obama. #RomneyNation #Romney2012
Hell yes! He came through and punched DOWN! RT @TiaraSoBoojie: Do you guys feel like <e>Obama</e> <a>reclaimed</a> his victory with this debate??
<e>Obama</e> just <a>lying</a> now.
<e>Romney</e> is a genuinely <a>nice</a> guy. He has a great record in MASS. What does Obama have again? Oh, right.
@applejacks_hunt @joeymask1 Race has nothing to do with it I actually favored <e>Obama</e> against McCain..but everything he said was <a>lies..</a>
<e>Obama</e> needs to shut up, he made our <a>economy</a> shit
My grandparents think <e>Obama</e> is the <a>antichrist</a>
<e>Obama</e> is now saying he is a republican. He is right that there needs to be more free market an less gov <a>control.</a> That's what republicans do
<e>LIE...Obama</e> <a>calls</a> the private sector as the enemy.
<e>Obama:</e> I believe that everybody should have a <a>fair</a> shot... Do their fair share... Play by the same rules. #NBCPolitics
Check <a>Mate</a> President <e>Obama!</e>
#debate "there are some <a>jobs</a> that won't come back". <e>Obama.</e> Get off your ass and make corp. <a>Taxes</a> competative, and stop blocking anwar.
Once again <e>Obama</e> is not <a>answering</a> the question
<e>Obama</e> has done nothing for vets but <a>insult</a> them.
<e>#Obama's</e> literally putting me to <a>sleep</a> #townhalldebate
The last 4 years didn't work out like <e>Obama</e> <a>promised,</a> it's time to move on and give Mitt Romney the chance to fix these mistakes #addebate2
The only way I would vote for <e>Obama</e> is if he <a>banded</a> soccer from The United States .
<e>Obama</e> why does your 2min seem like forever? <a>#blahblahblah</a>
<e>Obama</e> just <a>*Tebowed*</a> on his ass!!!!
<e>Obama:</e> "I believe in <a>self-reliance."</a> Mr. President, I'm sorry, but I rely on God. He wakes me up and I live for Him. #HowItWorks
Mr. <e>Obama,</e> the only thing you've been fighting for is the use of my <a>money!</a> #2012debates
Romney 40:50 and <e>Obama</e> 44:04. Wonder how many times Obama and Crowley <a>shouted</a> Mitt down.
Anytime <e>Obama</e> talks about <a>believing</a> in America and Americans, I just don't believe it.
<e>Michelle</e> Obama is one tall <a>bitch!</a>
Bottom line, <e>Romney</e> <a>did</a> a great job tonight of reminding people of the failed Obama policies over the past 4 years.
What's funny is, I think Mr. <e>Romney</e> <a>did</a> better this debate. Raising your voice and saying Obamacare a lot in first debate was not a victory.
Ig I'm the only one who <a>doesn't</a> <a>like</a> <e>Obama.</e>
My dad annoys me with how much he thinks <e>Obama</e> is like satan and <a>evil.</a> #chill #hesnotplottingtodestroytheuniverse
& u look like a non muthaf*ckin factor RT @realDonaldTrump: <e>Obama</e> is looking rhetorical and <a>weak.</a> @MittRomney is looking strong and sharp
@CNBC2012 <e>Obama</e> may have won the battle but will he win the war?  4 more years of Obama is 4 more years of <a>Failure.</a>
I <a>hate</a> that the <e>reporters</e> reporting after the debate are getting on President Obama!
#the <e>debate</e> is <a>boring</a> to watch after a while. I get tired of hearing Obama go ummm, ughhhh, and well actually... #anoying
is <e>Obama</e> trying to debate about guns? he doesn't know a thing about <a>guns</a> and that's #fact
@gretawire I felt bad for <e>Obama,</e> he lost 2 <a>debates</a> .His record  looks bad.
@papchuseyo <e>Obama</e> <a>sucks...</a>
@CNBC2012 Moderator <e>Candy</e> Crowley is <a>biased!!!</a> You dont interupt Romney so Obama can speak. She shouldnt be allowed to vote!!!!
Yes, it's hard to change a country in 4 years. But <e>Obama</e> knew that when he promised he would do it... And he <a>didn't.</a>
#hofdebate all the hard work and sacrifice of the Hofstra community and <e>Obama</e> didn't even have the <a>courtesy</a> of acknowledging where he was!
@GMA @ThisWeekABC @GStephanopoulos - I hope y'all won't miss and/or dodge the fact that (a) <e>#Obama</e> <a>LIED</a> and (b) Candy ran interference.
Stfu. RT @realDonaldTrump: Such long <a>rhetorical</a> and boring answers from <e>Obama.</e> No wonder nothing gets done.
@Evan_Sofa so is <e>Obama</e> but you don't see him <a>bragging</a> about it
<e>Obama</e> exceeded expectations, a low bar set by the last debate, yet he still <a>loses.</a> He's shared no vision for what he'd do w/ 4 more years.
<e>I</e> <a>unfollowed</a> her ass for saying team Obama. #thatshitstopstoday
It's amazing how Romney criticizes <e>@BarackObama</e>  for what he didn't do but his <a>plans</a> will take 5-8 years to see real change. #NOT BACKWARDS!
Approx Time period: Obama had 43:57. <e>Romney</e> had 40:48. Romney with the <a>win!</a>
I really just <a>don't</a> <a>like</a> <e>Obama</e>
Contentious, but one is telling the truth and the other is <a>lying.</a> <e>Obama=liar.</e> Romney=truth.
I know y'all won't agree, but I don't care because I love my <a>God.</a> I really think <e>Obama</e> isn't following Him at all and that's the main reason
If to win this debate is to tell the most <a>lies,</a> then <e>Obama</e> won. #townhalldebate
<e>Romney</e> should have just gone over and just <a>kicked</a> Obama in the shin....lol!!
Sexual chocolate !! RT @Ravens_Examiner: Drop the mic <e>Obama.......DROP</e> THE <a>MIC!!!!</a>

Obama <e>needed</e> the moderator to <a>bail</a> him out and also called a man named Kerry "Kerr". lol
@ConservativeBro I think Romney won,because <e>Obama</e> told several outright <a>lies,that</a> everyone know were lies.Same ol' same ol.
@LindsayK62589 I <a>hate</a> <e>Obama!</e>
<e>Obama</e> <a>bothers</a> me...please stop talking about how great he is.
No one is voting for <e>Obama</e> because he is <a>black</a> I swear to God y'all are so STUPID
@cedriclabonte Mitt <e>Romney</e> did it (create <a>jobs,</a> balanced <a>budgets</a> and <a>Business</a> turnaround). Obama not.
Poor <e>Obama</e> felt offended.  He is not used to having to answer for the <a>truth!</a> #debates
@SammyRose7 omg <e>she</e> is so obviously <a>biased!</a> It was not fair at all she was consistently helping Obama! I'm so mad
Obama and <e>Romney</e> are both terrible candidates, but Romney is less <a>worse</a>
<e>Obama..</e> sorry but I cant vote for <a>you..</a> unfortunately I'm Canadian
<e>Obama</e> <a>could</a> <a>not</a> <a>defend</a> his indefensible record.  #debates
@markknoller <e>she</e> was too busy <a>interrupting</a> Romney and trying to help Obama to get rolled. She let O have 4 minutes longer that R.
Obama got 4 more mins because he kept cutting him off,# <e>Donna</e> Brazile is so <a>stupid</a>
@spaceghostturrt okay... Sooo that means we should just let <e>Obama</e> keep fuckin us up? Pretty sure he tripled our <a>dept.</a>
People don't even know what <e>Obama</e> doing for us they just saying vote for him cause he <a>black.</a>
Bottom line, <e>Obama's</e> <a>policies</a> have failed for 4 years &, if reelected, there is no reason to expect anything different over the next 4 years
My take on debate: Obama did better than last debate, but not good enough. <e>Romney</e> held his own. Both had hits & misses, but Romney <a>won.</a>
<e>Obama</e> <a>suuucks.</a>
@BeirutToJupiter Yeah I saw that :) the content of what <e>Romney</e> was saying seemed more <a>prepared</a> than Obama. The Pres. prob. had a busier day.
<e>Obama=</e> broken <a>promises.</a> Romney= evidence of promises fulfilled.#reliability #Romney2012
And 4 years later.......... <e>Obama</e> has yet to put on his working boots. How do u <a>lie</a> to get into office and not do anything unsaid u would
@ABC <e>Your</e> too <a>bias</a> for Obama. So it doesn't matter what you request.
#R_E_T_W_E_E_T for Obama .. <a>Favorite</a> for <e>Romney</e> !!!
Iv never really been into politics..but im thinking about voting this year..jus to try and help keep <e>Obama</e> <a>out</a> of office.
@ellencarmichael @mittromney Even more disturbing, seemed like <e>Candy</e> set up every topic to leave last <a>word</a> to Obama

What President <e>Obama</e> did on Romney was an <a>"Act</a> <a>of</a> <a>Terror".</a>
<a>Lying</a> is an integral part of <e>Obama's</e> character. He's hopeless. #debate
Well done @MittRomney . <e>Obama</e> flat out <a>lied</a> tonight and the moderator pitched in some out of context statements in Obamas favor. #debates
<e>Obama</e> <a>lowered</a> <a>my</a> <a>IQ</a> tonight
It's really not even that I really like Romney, I just really <e>hate</e> <a>Obama.</a>
But <e>Obama</e> is no different from all the other US presidents as far as <a>policies</a> go,they all about war & lots of injustices.
@danful38 And Obama said failed <a>policy's</a> of Bush, caused the gas to be low.  Well I guess <e>Obama's</e> failed policy's have let it rise, lol

 <e>Obama</e> says they knew it was <a>terrorism</a> the whole time they were trying so hard convince us it was a video?                           
 <e>Obama</e> was talking to the base. Three weeks out is a bad sign. To use Obama's word "It's not smartly."                           
 http://t.co/E4bukRsI @akstkpkr2 @BonzerWolf @crazykids6 @DanielRyanEvans <e>Obama</e> isn't <a>working</a> and <e>Americans</e> need to start working.                           
 <e>Obama</e> simply didn't <a>answer questions</a> he didn't like  and lied about the rest. Obama has no facts and doesn't know anything.

 @Dee_so_Dope blah blah blahhh. <e>Obama</e> <a>said he was going to fix it</a> his first term! Just another broken promise.                           
 See prev  add: also <e>Obama</e> was just <a>tooting his own horn</a> when he was calling HClinton as subservient to him. Yesterday he was...     
 @gretawire <e>Obama</e>! Interrupts when he doesn't know how to<a> answer</a> or no way to lie out of an answer or blame someone else for his mistakes

 "Obama: "I'm the <e>president</e> and I'm always responsible." Is that why you spent the past four years <a>blaming Bush</a>? "                           
 @CNN by the way  who is the smartest US <e>president</e> in the history? What's Obama's ranking <a>compare to him</a>?

 Couldn't agree more RTâ€°Ã›Ã@DebSpillane: The idea that Americans expected <e>Obama</e> to <a>fix the <e>economic</e> </a>mess US was in inside 4 yrs astonishes me.                           
 When people say 4 years wasnt enough for <e>Obama</e> to fix 8 years of Bushes fuck ups.. But it was enough to get us <a>double the deficit</a>..s Sick

 On Oct 4 @fivethirtyeight gave <e>Obama</e> 84% chance of <a>winning</a>. By Oct 14  dropped to 63%. 320 electoral votes to 284 (needs 270). Now 64.8%/287

 <e>president</e> <e>Obama</e> alluded to the <a>Fair Pay Act</a> being a statute of limitations change last night.

 Best statement by a focus group member:  <e>Obama</e> "is bullshitting on everything."                           
 <e>Obama</e> should start challenging leaders to dunk contests. Like   "Hey China  double or nothing on the <a>national debt</a>?" Boom. Economy solved."
